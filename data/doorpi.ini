[SIP-Admin]
# Phone numbers listed here may call DoorPi at any time (unless another call is active) and listen
# to its microphone's input or trigger DTMF actions (see below).
# Note: This will trigger different events from outgoing calls.
# This section contains definitions in the form of
#   <number> = <active>
# <number> is a telephone number or SIP address
# <active> is the literal text "active" (without quotes)

[DTMF]
# This sections contains definitions in the form of
#   <seq> = <action>
# where <seq> is a sequence of DTMF tones (keys on your phone's keypad)
# for more information about <action>s, see [EVENT_...] below

# This sections contains definitions in the form of
#   <kb_alias> = <type>
# where <kb_alias> is an arbitrary name and <type> is one of:
# - filesystem: pseudo-keyboard using files (requires `watchdog` python module)
# - gpio: RaspberryPi onboard header (requires `RPi.GPIO` python module)
# - piface: PiFace IO expander (requires `piface` python module)
# - pn532: PN532 NFC module (requires `nfc` python module)
# - rdm6300: RDM6300 RFID module (requires `serial` python module)
# - serial: Serially connected keyboard (requires `serial` python module)
#
# In the following sections' headers, replace <kb_alias> with the alias set here.

#[keyboard_settings_<kb_alias>]
# This section configures the keyboard named <kb_alias>, with possible options
# depending on the keyboard type selected in [keyboards].

# Bounce time (ms), during which repeated input will be ignored

# Pin logic polarity. HIGH: VCC = True (pressed), LOW: VCC = False (not pressed)
#polarity = HIGH
# Fire OnKeyPressed when the key is pushed down (False = when it is released)

### filesystem-specific options ###
# Reset files back to False after reading
#reset_input = True
# Directory for input files
#base_path_input = /run/doorpi/<kbalias>/in
# Directory for output files
#base_path_output = /run/doorpi/<kbalias>/out

### gpio-specific options ###
# Address mode (BOARD or BCM)
#mode = BOARD
# Configure pull-up / pull-down resistor (OFF, UP or DOWN)
#pull_up_down = OFF

### pn532-specific options ###
# Note: it is recommended to raise the "bouncetime" to at least 5 seconds
# Serial port's device file (usually /dev/ttyAMA0)

### rdm6300-specific options ###

#[keyboard_input_<kb_alias>]
# This section contains definitions in the form of
#   <pin> = <action>
# <pin> will be configured as input, if necessary.
# For more information about <action>s, see [EVENT_...] below.
# Specify no action to handle the key press in an [EVENT_...] block, see below.

#[keyboard_output_<kb_alias>]
# This section contains definitions in the form of
#   <pin> = <pin_alias>
# where <pin_alias> is an arbitrary name for use in `out:`-actions

#[EVENT_<eventname>]
# Instead of defining single actions inline in [<kb_alias>_InputPins] or [DTMF], you can
# use these event blocks to fire multiple actions in order.
# Each event block contains definitions in the form of
#   <order> = <action>
# <order> is an arbitrary key used to order the actions, two numeric digits recommended
# <action> is an action definition of the form
#   <type>:<parameters>
# with <parameters> being a comma separated list of parameters, and <action> one of:
# - call:<address>
#       Call the specified SIP address (ex: 'call:**613#614')
# - out:<pin_alias>,<value>[,<stop_value>,<hold_time>[,<interrupt>]]
#       set output pin <pin_alias> to <value>
#       after <hold_time> seconds elapse, set it to <stop_value>
#       if input pin <interrupt> is triggered, cancel the timer
# - os_execute:<command>
#       execute <command> with /bin/sh
# - mailto:<receiver>,<subject>,<message>,<snapshot>
#       send a mail to <receiver>, with subject <subject> and message body <message>
#       if <snapshot> is True, attach the latest snapshot
# - sleep:<time>
#       wait <time> seconds before continuing
# - hangup:<time>
#       wait <time> seconds, then hang up the active SIP call
# - file_call_value:<file>
#       call the SIP address specified in <file>
# - log:<message>
#       print <message> into the log file
# - take_snapshot:
#       take a snapshot
# An example event definition might look like this:
#[EVENT_OnKeyDown_<kb_alias>_7]
## switch on lights
#20 = out:lights,1
## take a snapshot of the person outside
## the snapshot may be displayed on a wall-mounted tablet inside the house,
## or be sent via mail if nobody answered the call in [EVENT_OnSipPhoneCallTimeoutNoResponse]
#40 = take_snapshot:
## initiate the SIP call
